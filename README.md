# PerimeterOfParallelogram

Explanation Line by Line:
Import Scanner Class:

java

        import java.util.Scanner;
This line imports the Scanner class from the java.util package, which is used to read input from the user.

Class Declaration:

java

        public class ParallelogramPerimeter {
This line declares a public class named ParallelogramPerimeter.

Main Method Declaration:

java

        public static void main(String[] args) {
This line starts the declaration of the main method, which is the entry point of the program.

Create Scanner Object:

java

        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
This line creates a Scanner object named in to read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard).

Prompt User for Side Lengths:

java

        System.out.println("Enter the length of the first side of the parallelogram:");
        double sideA = in.nextDouble(); // Reads the input in double
These lines prompt the user to enter the length of the first side of the parallelogram and read the input as a double.

java

        System.out.println("Enter the length of the second side of the parallelogram:");
        double sideB = in.nextDouble(); // Reads the input in double
These lines prompt the user to enter the length of the second side of the parallelogram and read the input as a double.

Calculate Perimeter:


        double perimeter = calculatePerimeter(sideA, sideB);
This line calls the calculatePerimeter method with sideA and sideB as arguments and stores the returned value in a variable named perimeter.

Print the Result:

java
    
        System.out.println("The perimeter of the parallelogram is: " + perimeter + " units");
This line prints the calculated perimeter to the console.

Close Scanner Object:

java

        in.close();
This line closes the Scanner object to free up resources.

End of Main Method:

java

}
This line marks the end of the main method.

Calculate Perimeter Method:


        private static double calculatePerimeter(double sideA, double sideB) {
This line declares a private static method named calculatePerimeter that takes two double parameters: sideA and sideB.

Perimeter Calculation:

java

        double perimeter = 2 * (sideA + sideB);
This line calculates the perimeter of the parallelogram using the formula 

        2(a+b).

        Return the Perimeter:

java

        return perimeter;
This line returns the calculated perimeter.

End of Method:

java

}
This line marks the end of the calculatePerimeter method.

End of Class:

java

}
This line marks the end of the ParallelogramPerimeter class.

Summary:
The class ParallelogramPerimeter contains two methods: calculatePerimeter and main.

The calculatePerimeter method computes the perimeter of a parallelogram given the lengths of its two adjacent sides.

The main method uses a Scanner to get the side lengths from the user, calls calculatePerimeter to compute the perimeter, and prints the result to the console.

calculatePerimeter(sideA, sideB what does this method mean

The method calculatePerimeter(sideA, sideB) is a call to a method named calculatePerimeter with two arguments: sideA and sideB. Let's break down what this means in the context of the Java code provided.

Method Call Breakdown:
Method Name: calculatePerimeter

This is the name of the method that will be executed. In the code, this method is defined to calculate the perimeter of a parallelogram.

Arguments: sideA and sideB

These are the values that are passed to the method. In this case, sideA and sideB are the lengths of the two adjacent sides of the parallelogram.

Detailed Explanation:
Method Definition:
java

    private static double calculatePerimeter(double sideA, double sideB) {
    // Formula for the perimeter of a parallelogram
    double perimeter = 2 * (sideA + sideB);
    
    // Return the calculated perimeter
    return perimeter;
}
        Access Modifier: private

This means the method can only be accessed within the same class.

        Static Modifier: static

This means the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class.

Return Type: double

The method returns a double value, which is the calculated perimeter.

        Method Parameters: double sideA, double sideB

The method takes two parameters, both of type double, representing the lengths of the two adjacent sides of the parallelogram.

Method Body:
Perimeter Calculation:

java

    double perimeter = 2 * (sideA + sideB);
This line calculates the perimeter using the formula 

2(a+b), where a is sideA and b is sideB.

Return Statement:

java

return perimeter;
This line returns the calculated perimeter value.
